Description: A set of tools that solves a common set of
problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces,
operate on each piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For
example, you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or
time point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse
high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The development
of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton Dickinson'.
